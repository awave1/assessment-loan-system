\section{What needed to be improved?}

The original project was not necessarily badly designed. It did contain some code smells and thus required some refactorings.

% What needed to be improved? That is, what “bad code smell” was detected? Use the terminology found in Chapter 3 of the Fowler text available from the course website/D2L.

\section{What refactoring were applied?}

% What refactoring was applied? What steps did you follow? Use the terminology and mechanics outlined in the Fowler text and illustrate the process with well-chosen code fragments taken from particular versions of your system. 

\section{What code in what files was the result of the refactoring?}

% What code in what files was the result of the refactoring.

\section{How was the code tested?}

% How was the code tested?

\section{Why is the code better structured after the refactoring?}

% Why is the code better structured after the refactoring? Does the result of the refactoring suggest or enable further refactorings?
